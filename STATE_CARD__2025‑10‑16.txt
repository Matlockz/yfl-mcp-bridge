YFL DRIVE BRIDGE — STATE CARD (2025‑10‑16)

TOGGLES
• Deep Research: ON
• Web/Browse: ON
• Connectors: Google Drive (scoped to /Your Friend Logan/ChatGPT_Assets/**)
• MCP/Bridge: ON (Streamable HTTP via /mcp)

LIVE FACTS (TODAY)
• Bridge running (Node 22), ngrok forwarding https://triennially-superwise-lilla.ngrok-free.dev → localhost:10000
• GAS Web App reachable (server-side), token matched
• Gates passed: Design, GAS, Drive, Connector, Inspector (functional parity)

FILES TO WATCH
• server.mjs, package.json, .env
• GAS deployment (who can access / execute as)
• smoke.ps1

WHAT’S NEXT (TOP 3)
1) Keep ngrok up during sessions; consider a persistent HTTPS host later.
2) Add version in /health and pin small Runbook updates.
3) Roll light “happy-path” tests into a nightly check (optional).

QUICK COMMANDS
• Start:  npm start
• Ngrok:  ngrok http --domain=triennially-superwise-lilla.ngrok-free.dev 10000
• Smoke:  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force; .\smoke.ps1

NOTES
• PowerShell 5.1 lacks &&/||; use newlines or upgrade to PS 7+. (Microsoft announced these operators in PS 7.)
